# TabFS

Mount your browser tabs as a filesystem.

## Examples of stuff you can do

(assuming your shell is in the `fs` subdirectory of this repo)

### List the titles of all the tabs you have open 

```
$ cat mnt/tabs/by-id/*/title
GitHub
Extensions
TabFS/install.sh at master Â· osnr/TabFS
Alternative Extension Distribution Options - Google Chrome
Web Store Hosting and Updating - Google Chrome
Home / Twitter
...
```

### Close all Stack Overflow tabs

```
$ echo close | tee -a mnt/tabs/by-title/*Stack_Overflow*/control
```

### Save text of all tabs to a file

(wip, FIXME)

```
$ cat mnt/tabs/by-id/*/text > text.txt
```

## Setup

First, install the browser extension.

Then, install the C filesystem.

### 1. Install the browser extension

(I think it will work on Edge or Opera or whatever, too. You'll need to
change the native messaging path in install.sh in those cases.)

#### in Chrome

Go to the [Chrome extensions page](chrome://extensions). Enable
Developer mode (top-right corner).

Load-unpacked the `extension/` folder in this repo.

Make a note of the extension ID. Mine is
`jimpolemfaeckpjijgapgkmolankohgj`. We'll use this later.

#### in Firefox

You'll need to install as a "temporary extension", so it'll only last
in your current FF session.

Go to [about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox).

Load Temporary Add-on...

Choose manifest.json in the extension subfolder of this repo.

### 2. Install the C filesystem

First, make sure you `git submodule update --init` to get the
`fs/cJSON` and `fs/base64` dependencies.

And make sure you have FUSE. On Linux, for example, `sudo apt install
libfuse-dev`. On macOS, get FUSE for macOS.

```
$ cd fs
$ mkdir mnt
$ make
```

Now install the native messaging host into your browser, so the
extension can launch and talk to the filesystem:

#### Chrome and Chromium

Use the extension ID you copied earlier.

```
$ ./install.sh chrome jimpolemfaeckpjijgapgkmolankohgj
```

or

```
$ ./install.sh chromium jimpolemfaeckpjijgapgkmolankohgj
```

### 3. Ready!

Go back to `chrome://extensions` or
`about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and reload the extension.

Now your browser tabs should be mounted in `fs/mnt`!

Open the background page inspector to see the filesystem operations
stream in. (in Chrome, click "background page" next to "Inspect views"
in the extension's entry in the Chrome extensions page; in Firefox,
click "Inspect")

This console is also incredibly helpful for debugging anything that
goes wrong, which probably will happen.

(My OS and applications are pretty chatty! They do a lot of
operations, even when I don't feel like I'm actually doing anything.)

## Design

- `extension/`: Browser extension, written in JS
  - [`background.js`](extension/background.js): **The most interesting file**. Defines all the
    synthetic files and what browser operations they map to.
- `fs/`: Native FUSE filesystem, written in C
  - [`tabfs.c`](fs/tabfs.c): Talks to FUSE, implements fs operations, talks to extension.

<!-- TODO: concretize this -->

When you, say, `cat` a file in the tab filesystem:

1. `cat` makes something like a `read` syscall,

2. which goes to the FUSE kernel module which backs that filesystem,

3. FUSE forwards it to the `tabfs_read` implementation in our
   userspace filesystem in `fs/tabfs.c`,

4. then `tabfs_read` rephrases the request as a JSON string and
   forwards it to the browser extension over 'native messaging',

6. our browser extension in `extension/background.js` handles the
   incoming message and calls the browser APIs to construct the data
   for that synthetic file;

7. then the data gets sent back in a JSON native message to `tabfs.c`
   and and finally back to FUSE and the kernel and `cat`.

(very little actual work happened here, tbh. it's all just
marshalling)

## hmm

it's way too hard to make an extension. even 'make an extension' is
a bad framing

now you have this whole 'language', this whole toolset, to control and
