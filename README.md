# TabFS

## Setup

First, install the browser extension.

Then, install the C filesystem.

### Install the browser extension

(I think it will work on Edge or Opera or whatever, too. You'll need to
change the native messaging path in install.sh in those cases.)

#### Chrome

Go to the [Chrome extensions page](chrome://extensions). Enable
Developer mode (top-right corner).

Load-unpacked the `extension/` folder in this repo.

Get the extension ID.

#### Firefox


### Install the C filesystem

First, make sure you `git submodule update --init` to get the
`fs/cJSON` and `fs/base64` dependencies.

And make sure you have FUSE. On Linux, for example, `sudo apt install
libfuse-dev`. On macOS, get FUSE for macOS.

```
$ cd fs
$ mkdir mnt
$ make
```

Now install the native messaging host into your browser, so the
extension can launch and talk to the filesystem:

```
$ ./install.sh [chrome | chromium | firefox]
```

### Ready

Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions`.

Now your browser tabs should be mounted in `fs/mnt`!

## Examples of stuff you can do

(assuming your shell is in the `fs` subdirectory)

### List the titles of all the tabs you have open 

```
$ cat mnt/tabs/by-id/*/title
GitHub
Extensions
TabFS/install.sh at master Â· osnr/TabFS
Alternative Extension Distribution Options - Google Chrome
Web Store Hosting and Updating - Google Chrome
Home / Twitter
...
```

### Close all Stack Overflow tabs

```
$ echo close | tee -a mnt/tabs/by-title/*Stack_Overflow*/control
```

### Save text of all tabs to a file

(wip, FIXME)

```
$ cat mnt/tabs/by-id/*/text > text.txt
```

## Design

- `extension/`: Browser extension, written in JS
- `fs/`: Native FUSE filesystem, written in C
  - `tabfs.c`: Talks to FUSE, implements fs operations, talks to browser.

When you, say, `cat` a file in the tab filesystem:

1. `cat` makes something like a `read` syscall,

2. which goes to the FUSE kernel module which backs that filesystem,

3. FUSE forwards it to the `tabfs_read` implementation in our
   userspace filesystem in `fs/tabfs.c`,

4. then `tabfs_read` rephrases the request as a JSON string and
   forwards it to the browser extension over 'native messaging',

6. our browser extension in `extension/background.js` handles the
   incoming message and calls the browser APIs to construct the data
   for that synthetic file;

7. then the data gets sent back in a JSON native message to `tabfs.c`
   and and finally back to FUSE and the kernel and `cat`.

(very little actual work happened here, tbh. it's all just
marshalling)

## hmm

it's way too hard to make an extension. even 'make an extension' is
a bad framing

now you have this whole 'language', this whole toolset, to control and
